SPHERE will have three testbed facilities -- at USC/ISI, at USC colocation space and at Northeastern University.
SPHERE will host heterogeneous resources that are relevant for cybersecurity and privacy experimentation, such as:
* server-class compute nodes for virtual machine allocation
* server-class compute nodes with GPUs for machine learning
* embedded CPUs for large-scale embedded systems experimentation
* programmable NICs
* PLCs and CPS simulation software for digital twinning
* remotely-controlled home IoT devices

Figure below illustrates our vision for SPHERE architecture:
